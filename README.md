# This is basically to note my machine learning journey

### machine learning (ML) is a key tool for gaining insights from complex data and driving innovation in many ndustries. As more businesses rely on data for decision-making, having machine learning skills is more important than ever. By mastering ML, you can tackle real-world problems and create innovative solutions that boost business success.

# `` What is Machine Learning? ``

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. The goal is to develop algorithms that can identify patterns, make decisions, and improve based on new data over 

# Machine Learning Pipeline

Machine learning is fundamentally built upon data, which serves as the foundation for training and testing models. Data consists of inputs (features) and outputs (labels). A model learns patterns during training and is tested on unseen data to evaluate its performance and generalization. In order to make predictions, there are essential steps through which data passes in order to produce a machine learning model that can make predictions.
