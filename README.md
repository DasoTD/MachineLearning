# This is basically to note my machine learning journey

### machine learning (ML) is a key tool for gaining insights from complex data and driving innovation in many ndustries. As more businesses rely on data for decision-making, having machine learning skills is more important than ever. By mastering ML, you can tackle real-world problems and create innovative solutions that boost business success.

```python
def hello():
    print("ML Journey!")
```
# `` What is Machine Learning? ``

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. The goal is to develop algorithms that can identify patterns, make decisions, and improve based on new data over 

``Artificial Neural Network `ANN`.``
